# Huffman Encoding and Decoding

This project implements a complete Huffman compression and decompression system in Java, developed as part of **Duke Universityâ€™s CS201: Data Structures and Algorithms** course.

The system reads an input file, constructs a frequency table, builds a Huffman tree, and encodes the content into a compressed binary format. It also supports decoding a compressed file back to its original content using the stored encoding map.

### Features
- Frequency analysis of input text
- Binary tree construction for optimal prefix codes
- Efficient file compression and decompression
- Command-line interface for encoding and decoding operations
